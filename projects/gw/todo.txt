UI
	attacker show free dmg based on best guess research
	show extra on-build move cost in dialog
	save off graph-less autosaves for replay?
		every turn?
	graph select turns
	repair form income show only base-upkeep ?
	rapid click to bombard
	rally ships
		current turn actual move always uses zoc?
		allow viewing all shortest paths?
		constant path
		waypoints
		show distance, turns
		left click drag to vector should not select target tile
	combat calc show probability table
	measure distances
	calculate pop growth
		balancing between colonies
	show enemy moves/attacks ignoring friendly ships, weight for HP?
	main map
		clean up drawing logic
		very large shows more info
			different ship graphics for speed/type
		very small shows clearer info
			draw anomalies smaller
			better distinction between ships and planets
	management screens

move start turn gold to after start turn ship
individual colony/planet have slightly different income ratios?S
verify last researched>current issues
	upg ship > current?
rchance > 1 throws off max
ship upg algorithm
using generate value instead of this value for compensation?
focuspcts mathematically might make the other two overall more likely
move order gold based on current average income?
gold income for anomaly research randomness
friendly bombard
	never kill pop
	confirm before completely destroy
	doesn't give free exp to both
new game parameters
	num anomalies (start/rate)
	differentiate starting and planet rate
	pop,prod,etc.
terrain from anomalies
	non-permanent
	slower move
	impassable
	damage
	att/def bonus
	random spread of tiles? apply effects to neighbors?
directly upgrade existing ships?
	to reduce repair cost?
	improve stats?
	obsolete designs?
increase minimum research chance
ship name value
ship name mult too high
anom design research randomness with higher values (any pct based randomness)
map size
ExpForSoldiers should be * 1.3 not / 1.3?
soldiers = meh
planetary defenses still not right
	auto upg turns 1-7 into 13-7
	upg PD when lastresearched > current
		cost uses last, upg uses current
	global random PD upg factor across all planets for the turn
research victory pct decreases with higher research
	10k=now
	30k=85% instead of 67%?
	uses real avg, graph calcs using average shown
	also decrease max display skew appropriately
trans upk payoff problem
	upkeep IS more severe, but cost ends up being reduced
rethink neg gold again
	don't like random disbanding - no adv over manual
	if keep impossible negative, make _goldValue a uint?
1:1 vs reduced payouts... analyze
rebalance global event?

ShipClass order
	order by tier, use in ShipsForm sort
6 tiers saved? return length?
graph dictionaries can be arrays
standardize Tile.Game vs Player.Game calls
remove static qualifiers to same class
standardize dead checks
test exact vs oversize dictionary capacity for combat performance
empirically test invasion values
clean up code
	member order
fix combatant/popcarrier/colony/pd hierarchy

influence
anomaly neutral ships?
known enemy designs
AI
	integrate AI-algorithm guesses into game for player to use as well
	event needs to be pulled out of other handler stuff and only show events for things visible to other players
