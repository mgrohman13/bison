GAMEPLAY

enforce attacking with all avail pop
free dmg/attack pct left takes into account att hp
map center use colony prod/pd
anom pull curplay lose move?
bombard combat get exp out instead of automatic add
bombard friendly paying for value exp at full at fll rate vs exp rate?
anomaly individual planet pct
anomaly gold balancing at full vs consolation value
	using generate value instead of this value for compensation?
	other compensation/general balancing?
	rebalance global event?
	gold income for anomaly research randomness
	anom design research randomness with higher values
		any pct based / OE randomness?
	anomaly add/lose pop redistribute to other colonies if over upper cap if possible?
	free dmg vs too good?  no risk for attacker?
1:1 vs reduced payouts... analyze
	e.g. soldiers "other" gives full gold?
rchance > 1 throws off max

prod repair randomness?
hide ship cost during repair somehow?
round prod repair?
	and leftoever prod?
make repair a buildable
use wormhole verification for move order ganks?
max design cost OE??

new game parameters
	num anomalies (start/rate)
	differentiate starting and planet rate
	pop,prod,etc.

planetary defenses still not right
	split between soldiers?

		random?
research victory pct decreases with higher research
	10k=now
	30k=85% instead of 67%?
	uses real avg, graph calcs using average shown
	also decrease max display skew appropriately
	actual chance vs display discrepency?
trans upk payoff problem
	upkeep IS more severe, but cost ends up being reduced
	reduce impact of speed in general, while at it?
	att/def adjusts slightly?
