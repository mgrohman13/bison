trans upk payoff problem
	upkeep IS more severe, but cost ends up being reduced

standardize dead checks
without tile cache, no longer need to use points instead of tiles in places
	replace all point usage with tile in gws (except serailized)
test exact vs oversize dictionary capacity for combat performance
empirically test invasion values
clean up code
	member order

anomaly neutral ships?
known enemy designs
AI
	integrate AI-algorithm guesses into game for player to use as well
	event needs to be pulled out of other handler stuff and only show events for things visible to other players
