UI

invade + bombard logging show max or actual quality dmg - consistency 
tab order on combat calc
show research victory on main window
diff log file per id
log out turn #
reg auto save identify game ID
	default save name too?
text overlaying other text / same color
replay
	overwrites when currentPlayer decrements
	final end game save include graphs
	parse correctly for history button
graph select turns / smoothing
rapid click to bombard
rally ships
	current turn actual move always use zoc, friendly ship blocks
		ensure shown path is path that will be taken this turn
	allow viewing all shortest paths? constant path?
	waypoints
		left click drag to vector should not select target tile
measure distances
calculate pop growth
	balancing between colonies
show enemy moves/attacks ignoring friendly ships, weight for HP?
main map
	clean up drawing logic
	very large shows more info
		different ship graphics for speed/type
	very small shows clearer info
management screens
	designs
		compare
		new research window has option to show compare desings for all designs
			toggle between obsolete/all?  visual discinction?
	re-do colony
	ships/colony view include enemy
		multi select with all players
keyboard?
combat predict performance
	partial-mathematical-resolve until limit is reached
	monte carlo?	


GAMEPLAY

ds trg pct max out at .21?
	consider making catapults more likely?
anomaly gold balancing at full vs consolation value
	using generate value instead of this value for compensation?
	other compensation/general balancing?
	rebalance global event?
	gold income for anomaly research randomness
	rebalance research OEPct?
anom design research randomness with higher values (any pct based randomness)
1:1 vs reduced payouts... analyze
	e.g. soldiers "other" gives full gold?
bombard free dmg based on attacker research??
	avg research?
civ zoc?
	rebalance?
anomaly add/lose pop redistribute to other colonies if over upper cap if possible?
why do enemy colonies show repair amt?
population w/o trans graph should also average?
move start turn gold to after start turn ship
rethink neg gold again
	don't like random disbanding - no adv over manual
	if keep impossible negative, make _goldValue a uint?
	current impl could work if guarantee popup always shows if possibility of sale 
	think of any start turn action?
individual colony/planet have slightly different income ratios?
	problem - people piling all excess pop on best planet
	maybe only up to quality?
verify last researched>current issues
	upg ship > current?
rchance > 1 throws off max
move order gold based on current average income?
new game parameters
	num anomalies (start/rate)
	differentiate starting and planet rate
	pop,prod,etc.
directly upgrade existing ships?
	to reduce repair cost?
	improve stats?
	obsolete designs?
increase minimum research chance
ship names
	ship name use value?
	ship name mult too high?
		back to x3?
	god tier name?
map size
soldiers
	ExpForSoldiers should be * 1.3 not / 1.3?
	soldiers = meh, completely redo?
planetary defenses still not right
	cost/eco/upg hiddenness?
	upg = full OE
	split between soldiers?
		random?
	auto upg turns 1-7 into 13-7
	upg PD when lastresearched > current
		cost uses last, upg uses current
	global random PD upg factor across all planets for the turn
research victory pct decreases with higher research
	10k=now
	30k=85% instead of 67%?
	uses real avg, graph calcs using average shown
	also decrease max display skew appropriately
trans upk payoff problem
	upkeep IS more severe, but cost ends up being reduced
	reduce impact of speed in general, while at it


SAVE FILES

ShipClass order
	order by tier, use in ShipsForm sort
6 tiers saved? return length?
graph dictionaries can be arrays
standardize Tile.Game vs Player.Game calls
remove static qualifiers to same class
standardize dead checks
test exact vs oversize dictionary capacity for combat performance
empirically test invasion values
clean up code
	member order
fix combatant/popcarrier/colony/pd hierarchy


VAGUE

terrain
	from anomalies?
	non-permanent
	slower move
	impassable
	damage
	att/def bonus
	random spread of tiles?
	apply effects to neighbors?
influence
anomaly neutral ships?
known enemy designs
AI
	integrate AI-algorithm guesses into game for player to use as well
	event needs to be pulled out of other handler stuff and only show events for things visible to other players
shroud
