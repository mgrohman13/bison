non DS bombard combat screen take into account free damage
autorepair off map indicator is worthless
clear enemy moves
	dialog
	undo
repair cost calculations using decimal places not rounded?
when planet is destroyed on invasion, retroactively give back gold/troops so that we don't have negative quality fudge factor of -2
combat calc show probability table
show enemy moves/attacks ignoring friendly ships, weight for HP?
test exact vs oversize dictionary capacity for combat performance
main map improvements
	ship speed/type
	zooming, panning
	minimap
management screens
	colonies
	ships

somehow pay to upgrade old designs?  manually weight what you want next?
alternate strength formula counting less speed?
revisit colony ship costs once more - maybe amount lost is constant?  related to planet?
undo
	Colony.StartBuilding
	Ship.Disband?
	Colony.DisbandPlanetDefense?
repair micromanagement
	cost incentive
		certain specific value?
		pct you have been doing?
no one builds soldiers...
refactor planet defense into separate class
split planetary defense between building attack or defense
	att/def:hp ratio?
	combine with solders?
	disband vs destory defensesoldiers payoff
soldiers tied to planet defense
	transport combats in order to invade?
switch prod to def/soldiers sells all?
research display offset

anomalies
	instead of planets
		if not too close
		planet chance is _planetPct/_anomalyPct
		pcts randomize slightly each turn
	research +value
		new design
			research based on current player (pre-add) total research and average player research
	wormhole
		this ship -> random tile
			chance to add cur speed?
		random ship -> this tile
		random planet -> this tile?
			cannot cause planets to be too close
		semi-permanent teleporter?
			cannot cause planets to be too close
	move anomaly? create more?
	additive ship cost for speed

known enemy designs
AI
	integrate AI-algorithm guesses into game for player to use as well
	event needs to be pulled out of other handler stuff and only show events for things visible to other players
