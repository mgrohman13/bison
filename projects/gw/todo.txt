compare two ships with cost calc
ShipDesign.GetIncrease evens things out?
combat calc show probability table
log more stuff!
	invasion
show enemy moves/attacks ignoring friendly ships, weight for HP?
test exact vs oversize dictionary capacity for combat performance
main map improvements
	ship speed/type
	zooming, panning
	minimap
management screens
	colonies
	ships

somehow pay to upgrade old designs?  manually weight what you want next?
Player._research, Player._lastResearched, ShipDesign._research
losepopulation addgold?
alternate strength formula counting less speed?
revisit colony ship costs once more - maybe amount lost is constant?  related to planet?
GetMoveSoldiers
	scrap randomness to allow undo?
		instead make reg and def soldiers the same, but keep more on planet when there is defense?
	use destination PopCarrier to ensure 1-at-a-time contract?
		multiply SoldiersRndm by Sqrt(movePop)?
		add together and re-rand entirely?
			be wary of abuse via doing 1-at-a-time until favorable roll
undo
	PopCarrier.MovePop
	Colony.StartBuilding
	Ship.Disband?
	Colony.DisbandPlanetDefense?
use player.ID (as byte) in graphs dictionary, cast GraphType to byte
repair micromanagement
	cost incentive
		certain specific value?
		pct you have been doing?
refactor planet defense into separate class
split planetary defense between building attack or defense
	att/def:hp ratio
sell planet def for gold floors total gold
randomize planet colonization cost
research display offset
Death Stars
	keep DS whole numbers?
	Ship.GetBombardLevelInc - div by att?
		att inc randomises bombard?
	ship design bombard min
	PlanetDefensesDeathStarMult (PopulationIncomeForGold)
	DeathStarPlanetDamageMult/DeathStarFriendlyPopDamageMult
	allow death stars to limit planet damage by pop left
incorporate gaussian OEs
transport exp for invasion?
ExperienceConstDmgAmt
extra combat exp for troops killed in transport, (troops get exp?)
extra bombard/invade exp for planet death
exp for bombard free damage (maintain startexp for logging...)

AI
integrate AI-algorithm guesses into game for player to use as well
known enemy designs
event needs to be pulled out of other handler stuff and only show events for things visible to other players
