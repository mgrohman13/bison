UI

min gold on ship build neg upkeep return
CostCalcForm DS/trans problems
bulding PD gold min/avg
research pct ugly - doesnt fit
display trying to wrap labels ugly
fix bombard not combining on form display
info popups go with old mouse coord?  should be coord on panel?
neg gold
	display issues?
test exact vs oversize dictionary capacity for combat performance
empirically test invasion values
invade + bombard logging show max or actual quality dmg - consistency 
tab order on combat calc
reg auto save identify game ID
	default save name too?
text overlaying other text / same color
replay
	overwrites when currentPlayer decrements
	final end game save include graphs
	parse correctly for history button
graph select turns / smoothing
rapid click to bombard
rally ships
	current turn actual move always use zoc, friendly ship blocks
		ensure shown path is path that will be taken this turn
	allow viewing all shortest paths? constant path?
	waypoints
		left click drag to vector should not select target tile
measure distances
calculate pop growth
	balancing between colonies
show enemy moves/attacks ignoring friendly ships, weight for HP?
main map
	clean up drawing logic
	very large shows more info
		different ship graphics for speed/type
	very small shows clearer info
management screens
	designs
		compare
		new research window has option to show compare desings for all designs
			toggle between obsolete/all?  visual discinction?
	re-do colony
	ships/colony view include enemy
		multi select with all players
	ShipDesignSortForm to compare actual ships
keyboard?
combat predict performance
	partial-mathematical-resolve until limit is reached
	monte carlo?	


GAMEPLAY

anom pull curplay lose move?
bombard combat get exp out instead of automatic add
anomaly individual planet pct
anomaly gold balancing at full vs consolation value
	using generate value instead of this value for compensation?
	other compensation/general balancing?
	rebalance global event?
	gold income for anomaly research randomness
	anom design research randomness with higher values
		any pct based / OE randomness?
	anomaly add/lose pop redistribute to other colonies if over upper cap if possible?
	free dmg vs too good?  no risk for attacker?
1:1 vs reduced payouts... analyze
	e.g. soldiers "other" gives full gold?
why do enemy colonies show repair amt?
	prod repair randomness?
rchance > 1 throws off max


BETWEEN GAMES

increase colonization cost?
new game parameters
	num anomalies (start/rate)
	differentiate starting and planet rate
	pop,prod,etc.
map size
soldiers
	ExpForSoldiers should be * 1.3 not / 1.3?
	soldiers = meh, completely redo?
planetary defenses still not right
	split between soldiers?
		random?
	auto upg turns 1-7 into 13-7
	buy defense?  produce but keep prod on ship?
		rethink concept of prod in general?  stored per design?
research victory pct decreases with higher research
	10k=now
	30k=85% instead of 67%?
	uses real avg, graph calcs using average shown
	also decrease max display skew appropriately
	actual chance vs display discrepency?
trans upk payoff problem
	upkeep IS more severe, but cost ends up being reduced
	reduce impact of speed in general, while at it
6 tiers saved? return length?
graph dictionaries can be arrays
standardize Tile.Game vs Player.Game calls
remove static qualifiers to same class
standardize dead checks
clean up code
	member order
fix combatant/popcarrier/colony/pd hierarchy


FEATURES

civ zoc?
	rebalance?
individual colony/planet have slightly different income ratios?
	problem - people piling all excess pop on best planet
	maybe only up to quality?
terrain
	from anomalies?
	non-permanent
	slower move
	impassable
	damage
	att/def bonus
	random spread of tiles?
	apply effects to neighbors?
influence
neutral ships?
	from anomaly?
known enemy designs
AI
	integrate AI-algorithm guesses into game for player to use as well
	event needs to be pulled out of other handler stuff and only show events for things visible to other players
shroud
directly upgrade existing ships?
	to reduce repair cost?
	improve stats?
	obsolete designs?
