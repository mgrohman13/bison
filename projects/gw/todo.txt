	undo move pop unholds planet (and maybe ship)
	researchLines rounding
	rapid click to bombard

	clear showMoves
		examples?
	combat calc show probability table
	measure distances
	calculate pop growth
		balancing between colonies
	show enemy moves/attacks ignoring friendly ships, weight for HP?
	keep track of observed income on planet since last build
	main map
		clean up drawing logic
		very large shows more info
			different ship graphics for speed/type
		very small shows clearer info
			draw anomalies smaller
			better distinction between ships and planets

move pop/soldiers always costs income?
trans upk payoff problem
	upkeep IS more severe, but cost ends up being reduced
gold needs adv in choose research or gold
ship name 3.9 might be too much
	and start with max instead of avg maybe?
	or, always use averages to reduce randomness creep?
increase gold payout for apocalypse
check randomness in add/remove pop in anomalies, maybe add/spend more gold
check colonization mult randomness
also take into account research until last pure str ship
research vict a little easier?
anomaly terraform quality amount
	also no longer also check income with new neg gold behavior
	tie terraform too expensive return false to actual quality increase
increase severity of planet dist check
ship soldier exp reduces by pct
AdjustCost check when anom ship
AdjustCenter before RemoveTeleporters
ResetResearchChance comments

standardize dead checks
without tile cache, no longer need to use points instead of tiles in places
	replace all point usage with tile in gws (except serailized)
test exact vs oversize dictionary capacity for combat performance
empirically test invasion values
clean up code
	member order

anomaly neutral ships?
known enemy designs
AI
	integrate AI-algorithm guesses into game for player to use as well
	event needs to be pulled out of other handler stuff and only show events for things visible to other players
