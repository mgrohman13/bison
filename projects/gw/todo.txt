test exact vs oversize dictionary capacity for combat performance
empirically test invasion values
invade + bombard logging show max or actual quality dmg - consistency

GAMEPLAY

enforce attacking with all avail pop
free dmg/attack pct left takes into account att hp
anom pull curplay lose move?
bombard combat get exp out instead of automatic add
bombard friendly paying for value exp at full at fll rate vs exp rate?
anomaly gold balancing at full vs consolation value
	using generate value instead of this value for compensation?
	other compensation/general balancing?
	rebalance global event?
	gold income for anomaly research randomness
	anom design research randomness with higher values
		any pct based / OE randomness?
	anomaly add/lose pop redistribute to other colonies if over upper cap if possible?
	free dmg vs too good?  no risk for attacker?
1:1 vs reduced payouts... analyze
	e.g. soldiers "other" gives full gold?
rchance > 1 throws off max


BETWEEN GAMES

round pop growth?
	meh
in progress
	ProdGuess
	prod per buildable
		UI
	turn inc calc
		mingold - remove?
	start game prod/pd
	pause build
	buy/sell/obsolete during callback
		allow sometimes
		restrict at handler wrapper level
	notify when could complete with stored
prod repair
	prod repair randomness?
	hide ship cost during repair somehow?
	round prod repair?
		and leftoever prod?
	make repair a buildable?
are fine?
	max design cost OE??
	level up uses full research?
		change to last?
new game parameters
	num anomalies (start/rate)
	differentiate starting and planet rate
	pop,prod,etc.
map size
planetary defenses still not right
	reducing stats/hp
	hp ratio?
		slighter more hp if stats not reduced?
		random?
research victory pct decreases with higher research
	10k=now
	30k=85% instead of 67%?
	uses real avg, graph calcs using average shown
	also decrease max display skew appropriately
	actual chance vs display discrepency?
trans upk payoff problem
	upkeep IS more severe, but cost ends up being reduced
	reduce impact of speed in general, while at it?
	att/def adjusts slightly?
6 tiers saved? return length?
graph dictionaries can be arrays
standardize Tile.Game vs Player.Game calls
remove static qualifiers to same class
standardize dead checks
clean up code
