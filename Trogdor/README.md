Abstract arcade game.

Control your acceleration using the arrow keys.  Either collect or avoid the other ones.  Avoid ramming into the map edge.  

Blue - you  
Green - spawned on the black dots, collecting these increases your size  
Red - running into these shrinks your size  
Black - stationary spawn points, destroying them gives score points but hurts you  

All dots, including your own, shrink over time.  The game is lost when your dot is reduced to nothing.
