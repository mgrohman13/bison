NEW
	can upgrade to just interim step 
	cycle through move first, then build	
	build form show distinction for can afford
	consolidate explored points around 0 into range tuple
	hide unused columns for build extractor/turret/etc only
	enemies go after long range attackers (esp turrets)
	enemies target with preference using AP/SP
	enemies dodge attacks
	income breakdown
	turrent chance to swap which attack does ap/sp?
	lower avg randomness?
	turret UpgradeBuildingCost sets rounding - affects shields
	reduce enemy ap/sp late
	increase avg shields
	decrease HP when shields,armor?
	armor + shields less likely
	ap + sp less likely
	ap/sp consistency in single unit?
		make multpl attacks more interesintg

IMPORTANT
	more move-left triggers (under attack, can attack if move, got attacked by unseen)
		ability disable for certain blueprints 	
	build turret starts with shields but upgrade doesnt
	
UI
	show sight range?
		fog will take care of?
	mouse over log entries to highlight
	if clicked log has no alive/visible pieces, go to attacked tile (store loc on log)
	for Log display, if selected piece didnt change dont refresh log
	selected piece shows double build range on mouse around
	better range drawing (no digit?  lines for cutoffs?  gradient?)?
	hard to see red on red one-hex range overlap
		also one-move min hard to see
	build form grows too big
	draw select on top of other ranges
		not done because need to see one-move minimum
	adjust scroll speed based on draw time
	off map edge logic not working well
	optimize drawrects to lines?
		might not even be optimization?
	optimize range drawing to single call
	toggle friendly range display
		filter by type, show total repair pct like enemy dmg
	show effects of research
	show constructor upgrade values
	show base values
		use tooltip for base value in attacks grid?
	highlight attacks from hidden enemies
		may be solved well enough by log improvements (click ability)
	hotkeys to jump to cardinal dir edges
	enemy move+range take into account unmovable tiles 
	minimap
	addtl logs? (repair? upgrade? build? research?)
	truncate range disp values
		since e.g. 2.0 may actually be 1.96 and not include 2 spaces away, so always show 1.9 if < 2
		include move cost indicator
		include cur move
	
GAMEPLAY
	attacker upgrades keep some old attacks/values

select box follow similar range width rules
move att/def draw boxes away from thick range lines
	if cur>0 ensure draw sliver
negative resources show red (not just inc)
negative resource punishment?
when unit selected, slow drawing (range not saved)
upg cur/max pcts should use StatValue
enemy dir (+cave) attack weights change over time, not eventually focus one dir
slow-paint scroll amt shouldnt take effect until 2nd tick so you can tap button once
dmg hurts saved up move?
dmg on any def can hurt att??
core use dmged pct for income??
	need quicker repair if so
	or really high resilience??
draw bars not use stat value for pct cur/max??
	maybe related to zoom, e.g. when zoomed out
	bigger bars when zoomed out
	clearer colors? darker?
log splash damage

	do way more damage, they already reload slowly
	nerf recovery even in range?
	rethink shield interaction?
	enemies clump more
	splash damage to higher values shouldnt be based on difference?
	does friendly damage
		melee??
rebal att/def type costs
also nerf shields? only regen when not attacked? chance to stop regen?

rock-paper-scissors balance?
save log to file on game end
rebal energy att, only +1 when attacking
Defended == took damage??
select terrain shouldnt hide log
places for aliens to repair (hive?)
	need to be able to pathfind back 
	store behavior state on enemy pieces for consistnet travel goal
rework turret research tree again? hp too low?
	need better early game def, better mid game att
turret more GC?
draw movement trail on map
draw grid first as lines, then overlay with full blocks
rename chasm??
draw chasm as single polygon
allow aliens to spawn in caves
	only until explored/hive killed?
	better pathfinding
	can spawn within hive range even if visible
view all mechs on datagrid popup
show mech # (alien #?) on map
show collected hive count on main screen?
info button show stats
	also build for all types?
map indicator with incoming attack direction
buff armor vs energy weapons?
better move left indicators?
	indicate when upgradeable
enemy target extractor more often
use terrain to store evaluate value to gradient on paint 
speed up attacks
	rounds = attackcur
    each roll range, draw on tie 
	50% chance of each attack passing?
	on att take dmg, 50% of reducing rounds?
	will make passive defense weaker
rethink picking defense algorithm, randomize slightly 
enemy attacks/moves	
	take into account new mechanics 
finish directional move/attack blocking
experience
assess both CombatTypes.GetRegen flag usage
	AI needs to know about
use range atack OR move and melee
cannot move and shoot raned attack
	new attack type that you can
		much less likely for alien spawns 
remove outliers from att/def bar length?
pull gen/upgrade value constants, research powers into special consts we can see and tweak together
attack range circle not accurate around corners
support rallying, multiple moves to get to destination
combined power grid, but if separate pieces impose power penalty?
	batteries - building/mechs

speed game up somehow?
randomize tech tree
alien morale
alien retreat when shield/weapons down
alien retreat to repair
metal types? 
right click piece info?

	unlock more game content, system similar to difficulty that incs separately?
evaluate use MemoryCache instead of Dictionary?
fix mirror image painting? may confuse in future?
building costs get more expensive with upgrade - countered by cost research
replace func tell you cost even if you cant afford
disband mech

	recycle?
log colors for weapon/def types?
	better log readability in general
partial attacks?
	use specific attack

fix build/repair/upgrade weirdness?
	remove some research?
	or clear up with colors?
building upkeep?
	disband/disable option
map contiguity
	instead, dont have walls limit move?
		two diff kinds of walls? block and not block?
		ensure spawns can reach core with move
		ensure hive points have gaps "close enough"
	use pathfinding to enforce? convert blocks
	pathfind from point to center using some random move value
		every X attempts, add a terrain override tile somewhere reachable by one of closest points touched so far
		increase pathfinding move value slightly every step??
		after finding final path, if contains override tiles make them permament map features
		test alg by cutting cave connectors
show mass/eng ratio on build screen? round mechs to 10? energy to 10? div by 10?
	income more random?
minimap
shroud

better balancing of starting mech
	cost, speed/vision
constructor better vision? quicker new constructors?
	move?
	???
	constructor outrun too many early aliens?
hardcoded initial scout mech?
things a little too defensive?
caves
	start with hive, mid-level units that dont move
		careful with long range killing early explorers?
	when hive attacked, spawn high-level units, free non-moving

COMBAT
rethink move?
have to not move to charge attacks?
limit moving/attacking?
	ranged cant do both?

map
	smaller?
	continguous
		force between core, hives, resources (? - ensure generate past gap?)
	water/islands
