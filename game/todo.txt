NEW
	can upgrade to just interim step 
	cycle through move first, then build	
	build form show distinction for can afford
	consolidate explored points around 0 into range tuple
	hide unused columns for build extractor/turret/etc only
	enemies go after long range attackers (esp turrets)
	enemies target with preference using AP/SP
	enemies dodge attacks
	income breakdown
	turrent chance to swap which attack does ap/sp?
	lower avg randomness?
	turret UpgradeBuildingCost sets rounding - affects shields
	reduce enemy ap/sp late
	increase avg shields
	decrease HP when shields,armor?
	armor + shields less likely
	ap + sp less likely
	ap/sp consistency in single unit?
		make multpl attacks more interesintg
	mouse move stops scroll
	show avg damage
	
IMPORTANT
	more move-left triggers (under attack, can attack if move, got attacked by unseen)
		ability disable for certain blueprints 	
	build turret starts with shields but upgrade doesnt
	
UI
	show sight range?
		fog will take care of?
	mouse over log entries to highlight
	if clicked log has no alive/visible pieces, go to attacked tile (store loc on log)
	for Log display, if selected piece didnt change dont refresh log
	selected piece shows double build range on mouse around
	better range drawing (no digit?  lines for cutoffs?  gradient?)?
	hard to see red on red one-hex range overlap
		also one-move min hard to see
	build form grows too big
	draw select on top of other ranges
		not done because need to see one-move minimum
	adjust scroll speed based on draw time
	off map edge logic not working well
	optimize drawrects to lines?
		might not even be optimization?
	optimize range drawing to single call
	toggle friendly range display
		filter by type, show total repair pct like enemy dmg
	show effects of research
	show constructor upgrade values
	show base values
		use tooltip for base value in attacks grid?
	highlight attacks from hidden enemies
		may be solved well enough by log improvements (click ability)
	hotkeys to jump to cardinal dir edges
	enemy move+range take into account unmovable tiles 
	minimap
	addtl logs? (repair? upgrade? build? research?)
	truncate range disp values
		since e.g. 2.0 may actually be 1.96 and not include 2 spaces away, so always show 1.9 if < 2
		include move cost indicator
		include cur move
	
GAMEPLAY
	attacker upgrades keep some old attacks/values
	unused upkeep on death?
	research/blueprint chances also based on current blueprints?
	use type research levels in blueprint cost?

constructor build range tied to move/vision
	cap repoair rate at 1 for calc until resaearch (factory too)
make artifact research slightly better vs energy extractors
increase extractor energy costs 2-4x

select box follow similar range width rules
move att/def draw boxes away from thick range lines

negative resource punishment?
when unit selected, slow drawing (range not saved)
research/overall balance
	enemies ramp up too much, research too slow
	reduce cost increase per completed research
	decrease ReserachFactor?
UpgDefenseType needs to maintain one of each type
	generated upg with no def
upg cur/max pcts should use StatValue
building hits taper off too much later on?
enemy dir (+cave) attack weights change over time, not eventually focus one dir
slow-paint scroll amt shouldnt take effect until 2nd tick so you can tap button once
dmg hurts saved up move?
auto repair needs to heal turret armor
cose use dmged pct for income?
repair changes getdmg value if happens first
	do we care...?
draw bars not use stat value for pct cur/max??
	maybe related to zoom, e.g. when zoomed out
	bigger bars when zoomed out
	clearer colors? darker?
log splash damage
stop using mech mass div or use evrywhere??

	does friendly damage
		melee??
rebal att/def type costs
also nerf shields? only regen when not attacked? chance to stop regen?
	new system use canrecover flag that get changed by diffe evtns? 
rock-paper-scissors balance?
reveal map [-250-250] on game end?
rebal energy att, only +1 when attacking
Defended == took damage??
select terrain shouldnt hide log
places for alieans to repair (hive?)
	need to be able to pathfind back 
	store behavior state on enemy pieces for consistnet travel goal
ok on research copleted screen should refresh resource/income info
rework turret reasearch tree again? hp too low?
	need better early game def, better mid game att
turret more GC?
draw movement trail on map
hives accidentally have integer attack ranges
draw grid first as lines, then overlay with full blocks
reanme chasm??
draw chasm as single polygon
allow aliens to spawn in caves
	only until explored/hive killed?

view all mechs on datagrid popup
show mech # (alien #?) on map
show collected hive cvount
info button show stats
	also build for all types?

repair shut off when attacked needs to be pushed out 1 turn
better move left indicators?
	indicate when upgradeable
enemy tareget extractor more often
ResearchFactor -> 2100
use terrain to store evaluate value to gradient on paint 
buildings take more dmg somehow? speed up attacks in general instead?
speed up attacks
	rounds = attackcur
    each roll range, draw on tie 
	50% chance of each attack passing?
	on att take dmg, 50% of reducing rounds?
	will make passive defense weaker
rethink picking defense algorithm, randomize slightly 
enemy attacks/moves	
	take into account new mechanics 
finish directional move/attack blocking
experience
assess both CombatTypes.GetRegen flag usage
	AI needs to know about
use repair rate for armor repair
buff range, nerf move, cannot move and shoot raned attack
	new attack type that you can
		much less likely for alien spawns 
nerf camping in factory
give hives more energy

remove outliers from att/def bar length?
pull gen/upgrade value constants, research powers into special consts we can see and tweak together
attack range circle not accurate around corners
support rallying, multiple moves to get to destination
use range atack OR move and melee
combined power grid, but if separate pieces impose power penalty?

animations
	all attacks
	enemy moves
research

true fractal noise... build on smaller with larger as map grows?
	how not retroactively affect explored??
alien types

map contiguity
	instead, dont have walls limit move?
		two diff kinds of walls? block and not block?
		ensure spawns can reach core with move
		ensure hive points have gaps "close enough"
	use pathfinding to enforce? convert blocks
	pathfind from point to center using some random move value

varaible scroll speed doesnt quite work
game stats
show map and log on game end
flatten tech tree		
map - occasional caves farther out infinteley??
		
EARLY GAME
mitigate balance of finding resources quicker?
	distance to core? resource value?
better balancing of starting mech
	cost, speed/vision
constructor better vision? quicker new constructors?
	move?
	???
	constructor outrun too many early aliens?
hardcoded initial scout mech?
things a little too defensive?
caves
	start with hive, mid-level units that dont move
		careful with long range killing early explorers?
	when hive attacked, spawn high-level units, free non-moving

TOP PRIORITY
rework repair

COMBAT
rethink move?
have to not move to charge attacks?
limit moving/attacking?
	ranged cant do both?
	melee limit move after attack? 
replace range with melee/ranged flag and accuracy(?), LOS rules, etc.
make num attacks/regen rate variables, reduce regen rate with dmg

map
	smaller?
	continguous
		force between core, hives, resources (? - ensure generate past gap?)
	water/islands
scrap research doesnt lower cur?
	wait... cur is calced
