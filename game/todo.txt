Consts.PathWidth	11.944130354249044	double

use debt instead of negative energy for hive spawns
	energy can still go negative?
unused upkeep on death?
exploration spawn chance?
upgrade OP??
	increase cost based on reasearch diff???
	based on time youve had mech??
biomass/metal ratio - but ambient generator??
icon for sleep
trying to sleep when cant moves next anyways
finish reasearch too fast?
	add more...
ambient gen power decreases over time??
	decrease dependent on total amount used that turn?
	generators still use shared value, the shared value is decreased
		applies to furutre generators
	can be counteracted by research
	min value = Consts.GeneratorResearchUpk * Consts.MassPerResearchConversion / Consts.BurnMassPerEnergy (5.5901699437494745)
		some const multiplier? between 1.69 - 5.2
		ArtifactEnergyUpkMult??
drone more expensive?
	especially later?
hives occasionally have very weak melee attack?
nerf drone defense?
	and constructor?
resources burn out faster??
kill pathfinding threads on exit
different icons for friendly range vs melee att available?
missile
	new missile types?
		small single target vs big splash damage??
			different functions 
				e.g. big splash damage gives more energy back to enemy?
	limit missiles fired per turn?
		2?
	also make turret a missile silo?
	allow replace missile silo to refund missiles?
	overkill affects alien energy inc?
	missiles use explosive att type
		account for it in enemy cost refund
	UI for Missile
upgrading shields/energy attacks need to charge?
make actual move tile obvious when using out of range path move
keep log on upgrade
aliens dont know how to use one-tile space to be safe from melee
better alien group behavior
	generate goals at turn start and factor them into alg?
		shift goals as pieces move?
	e.g. charge turret/ranged mech together
	random global weight powers each turn?
		clustered in areas?
	ehn enemy ends turn in player attack range, reduce that attack threat for future aliens
start enemy turn progress bar immediately
	might be long running pathfinding/spawning before moves
	start with some random fraction?
reveal wormhole if enemy uses 
enemies more likely to use
	esp in some states

NEW
	can upgrade to just interim step 
	cycle through move first, then build	
	consolidate explored points around 0 into range tuple
	hide unused columns for build extractor/turret/etc only
	enemies go after long range attackers (esp turrets)
	enemies dodge attacks
	income breakdown
	lower avg randomness?
	decrease HP when shields,armor?
	armor + shields less likely
	attack consistency in single unit?
		make multpl attacks more interesintg
	mouse move stops scroll
	show avg damage
	
IMPORTANT
	more move-left triggers (under attack, can attack if move, got attacked by unseen)
		ability disable for certain blueprints 	
	build turret starts with shields but upgrade doesnt
	
UI
	show sight range?
		fog will take care of?
	mouse over log entries to highlight
	if clicked log has no alive/visible pieces, go to attacked tile (store loc on log)
	for Log display, if selected piece didnt change dont refresh log
	selected piece shows double build range on mouse around
	better range drawing (no digit?  lines for cutoffs?  gradient?)?
	hard to see red on red one-hex range overlap
		also one-move min hard to see
	build form grows too big
	draw select on top of other ranges
		not done because need to see one-move minimum
	adjust scroll speed based on draw time
	off map edge logic not working well
	optimize drawrects to lines?
		might not even be optimization?
	optimize range drawing to single call
	toggle friendly range display
		filter by type, show total repair pct like enemy dmg
	show effects of research
	show constructor upgrade values
	show base values
		use tooltip for base value in attacks grid?
	highlight attacks from hidden enemies
		may be solved well enough by log improvements (click ability)
	hotkeys to jump to cardinal dir edges
	enemy move+range take into account unmovable tiles 
	minimap
	addtl logs? (repair? upgrade? build? research?)
	truncate range disp values
		since e.g. 2.0 may actually be 1.96 and not include 2 spaces away, so always show 1.9 if < 2
		include move cost indicator
		include cur move
	
GAMEPLAY
	attacker upgrades keep some old attacks/values
	research/blueprint chances also based on current blueprints?
	use type research levels in blueprint cost?
	upkeep doesnt scale
	repair decrease with pow?

	power grid
	research to automate mechs - big stat buff, less micromanagement

map
	use deterministic prng (or separate noise func?) to create curves, width changes
		give terrain features a max range of effectg and use that to generate
		use same noise func, but interp points somehow?
	better ensuring of path that doesnt rely on spawns?
		when skinnier, increase mult in mid
	feature dist fall off nonlinearly to maintain smaller corridors farther out

research
	require more to finish tree

map
	convert everthing to lines (actually segments or rays)
	paths have 2 parallel rays
	evaluate calc based on distance from nearest 2 lines
		set such that paths are filled in the center
	caves, center also have shaped area 
		all segment/ray endpoints have shaped area?
	eval=.5 feature dist also use shape logic

melee explosive attack...

treasure resource estimate account for massmult
repair HP cost < armor (e.g. late game constructor)

dependencies for alien research tree
	only a chance of enforcing, not always?
	range + energy -> laser
	range -> explosive
	?

EARLY GAME
mitigate balance of finding resources quicker?
	distance to core? resource value?
better balancing of starting mech
	cost, speed/vision
constructor better vision? quicker new constructors?
	move?
	???
	constructor outrun too many early aliens?
caves
	start with hive, mid-level units that dont move
