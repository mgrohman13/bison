NEW
	can upgrade to just interim step 
	cycle through move first, then build	
	consolidate explored points around 0 into range tuple
	hide unused columns for build extractor/turret/etc only
	enemies go after long range attackers (esp turrets)
	enemies dodge attacks
	income breakdown
	lower avg randomness?
	decrease HP when shields,armor?
	armor + shields less likely
	attack consistency in single unit?
		make multpl attacks more interesintg
	mouse move stops scroll
	show avg damage
	
IMPORTANT
	more move-left triggers (under attack, can attack if move, got attacked by unseen)
		ability disable for certain blueprints 	
	build turret starts with shields but upgrade doesnt
	
UI
	show sight range?
		fog will take care of?
	mouse over log entries to highlight
	if clicked log has no alive/visible pieces, go to attacked tile (store loc on log)
	for Log display, if selected piece didnt change dont refresh log
	selected piece shows double build range on mouse around
	better range drawing (no digit?  lines for cutoffs?  gradient?)?
	hard to see red on red one-hex range overlap
		also one-move min hard to see
	build form grows too big
	draw select on top of other ranges
		not done because need to see one-move minimum
	adjust scroll speed based on draw time
	off map edge logic not working well
	optimize drawrects to lines?
		might not even be optimization?
	optimize range drawing to single call
	toggle friendly range display
		filter by type, show total repair pct like enemy dmg
	show effects of research
	show constructor upgrade values
	show base values
		use tooltip for base value in attacks grid?
	highlight attacks from hidden enemies
		may be solved well enough by log improvements (click ability)
	hotkeys to jump to cardinal dir edges
	enemy move+range take into account unmovable tiles 
	minimap
	addtl logs? (repair? upgrade? build? research?)
	truncate range disp values
		since e.g. 2.0 may actually be 1.96 and not include 2 spaces away, so always show 1.9 if < 2
		include move cost indicator
		include cur move
	
GAMEPLAY
	attacker upgrades keep some old attacks/values
	unused upkeep on death?
	research/blueprint chances also based on current blueprints?
	use type research levels in blueprint cost?
	upkeep doesnt scale
	repair decrease with pow?
	negative mass/energy shuts things off
	enforce information hiding at project level

FEATURES

	experience
	power grid

no observable instance of aliens protecting each other yet 
need to hit extractors more when rushing?
	new state??

fix weights
	fix anything triggering multiplier - esp MAX
	repair not high enough? stay in retreat until repaired? only if actively repairing?
	normalize coreWeight
	attPct too high due to inclusion of weight?
	quit using killweight, avoid using raw stat values
		bring everything down to an fairly consisten level similar to repair 
		crank up powers, mults at the end
	OR crank everything up to exp and sqrt end
	pathWeight maybe looking good rn
		could be more extreme??
	not staying out of player attacks??
	OR 
	put all weights in range 0-1 and combine intelligently?
improve getkillweight
	prioritize constructor>factory>extractor>core
		add another state to weight extractors and even target them down?
			or have them kill extractors during rush?	
redo GetKillWeight
	repair/build numbers??
	values too high in general?
	target extractor more often?
	use more states??
move CombatTypes.GetReloadBase out of IAttacker.Values
	reload values also too high?

enemy attacks/moves	
	smarter about not attacking to recharge weapon
		always attack if about to die, otherwise favor recharge
	do they run away to charge shields?
	make better about not retreat pathing through player units
map contiguity / pathfinding / alien behavior
	constructors need to be able to reach resources
		just keep constructor limit very high and not worry about it for now?
	aliens repair at cave/hive(new object?)
		could add core and repair points as separate pathfind targets with same structure
			any way to share??
		spawn killable alien repair points in map paths too? every X distance?
	do enemy pathfinding in background during player turn?	
	builds up too many paths over time - duplicate paths with diff speeds

need to be able to visualize AI alg on map
measure enemy move performance with stopwatch
	expect pathfinding to take the most time but not happen often 
implement pathfinding for player!
core efficiency UI confusion with income pct 
defending passive defense shouldnt be guaranteed?
research aliens
	start showing morale, state, path
	radar to show dots where they are at decent distance
		better when we get shroud...
		new structure? addon to turrets with upgrade?
		upg to show resources,anything else?
when move hovering for constructor, take original repair range out of ranges
alien bravery stat?
support a selectValue with doubles?
clean up MattUtil pathfinding c/p

		pick the least move from start that is within visible of enemy piece
	also explore vision along full line path
research aliens
	kill, research corpse?
	show info like state and morale 
random aliens alien auto repair for increased cost??
	if we ever take out auto repair in vision range
Tile should just be a struct...?
	eqaluity always there, stores no real data, piece looks up in collection 
	no need for a million points?
dont serialize Noise, save seed/params instead
if all weapons hit 0 treat as passive defender??
	prob not - dont like sudden cutoff
TEST_MAP_GEN poorly designed, have to reference it everywhere we use visible 
	also shoudnt save map either
tie shield regen to StatValue (so regen more when lower)??
	though seems to work neatly with hits defending when shield gets low to let it recover
	regen rate lowered by hppct/resilience efficiency
	only regen when not attacked?? regen less?? chance to stop regen?? specific att types??
		new system use canrecover flag that get changed by diffe evtns? 
	make shield regen variable
		reduce with dmg pct?
explosives too weak?
	dmg on any def can hurt att??
	taking dmg hurt attacks even for non-hits????
	splash damage not tied to initial dmg??
	rethink shield interaction?
	enemies clump more
	does friendly damage?
		melee??
repair rate use Consts.GetDamagedValue?
pay back stored energy on death
make shield regen variable
	reduce with dmg pct?
better "lowPenalty" ramp up logic
rebalance resilience - remove / 2.0 from GetDamagedValue		
hardcoded references to .5, .25 terrain cuttoffs			
movement - long term
	start with just inc, lose all at turn end
	reserach "battery" or "booster" 
		gives a max value to save up to
		actual limit is always 2x max? no seperate variable?
move Map inner classes to partial class files
show inc/upk breakdown
	eng break down by att/shield/move/mech/constructor
	mass break down by building/mech (types??)
select box follow similar range width rules
move att/def draw boxes away from thick range lines
	if cur>0 ensure draw sliver
negative resources show red (not just inc)
negative resource punishment?
when unit selected, slow drawing (range not saved)
slow-paint scroll amt shouldnt take effect until 2nd tick so you can tap button once
core use dmged pct for income??
	need quicker repair if so
	or really high resilience??
draw bars not use stat value for pct cur/max??
	maybe related to zoom, e.g. when zoomed out
	bigger bars when zoomed out
	clearer colors? darker?
log splash damage
show total cost in info
weak geneartor buildings for foundations
select tile square always draw on top
save log to file on game end
select terrain shouldnt hide log
draw movement trail on map
draw grid first as lines, then overlay with full blocks

finish directional move/attack blocking
experience
use range atack OR move and melee
cannot move and shoot ranged attack
	new attack type that you can
		much less likely for alien spawns 
remove outliers from att/def bar length?
pull gen/upgrade value constants, research powers into special consts we can see and tweak together
attack range circle not accurate around corners
support rallying, multiple moves to get to destination
combined power grid, but if separate pieces impose power penalty?
	batteries - building/mechs
		excess power convert to research
	moving slower takes less energy?
speed game up somehow?
randomize tech tree
metal types? 
right click piece info?
	attack though?? left click?
use tooltips?
	piece info on mouse over? 
	tutorial type stuff?
animations
	all attacks
	enemy moves
research
	upgs show amt - exact where can e.g. core shields
	exponential tiers - first excess power, then mining, etc.
true fractal noise... build on smaller with larger as map grows?
	how not retroactively affect explored??
alien types
	discover, reasearch?
	weaknesses? learn??
metagame system pts
	-1 to play
	get for win or lose
	spend for bonuses? unlocks? start with?
	beat easy unlocks normal unlocks hard difficulty?
	unlock more game content, system similar to difficulty that incs separately?
Evaluate use MemoryCache instead of Dictionary?
fix mirror image painting? may confuse in future?
building costs get more expensive with upgrade - countered by cost research
replace func tell you cost even if you cant afford
disband mech
	turn off power?
	put on patrol/scout/etc mode for reduced power?
		careful not to make too good
		or dont allow rapid enable/disable 
			they take turn first
			cost one extra turn to flip on / off
	recycle?
building upkeep?
	disband/disable option
log colors for weapon/def types?
	better log readability in general
partial attacks?
	use specific attack

	remove some research?
	or clear up with colors?
show mass/eng ratio on build screen?  
minimap
shroud
	show last spotted aliens
	keep alien vision in shroud for 1 turn after move out of vision?
varaible scroll speed doesnt quite work
game stats
flatten tech tree	
		randomize
map - occasional caves farther out infinteley??
refactor Consts.MechMassDiv - only apply in one spot?
		
EARLY GAME
mitigate balance of finding resources quicker?
	distance to core? resource value?
better balancing of starting mech
	cost, speed/vision
constructor better vision? quicker new constructors?
	move?
	???
	constructor outrun too many early aliens?
hardcoded initial scout mech?
caves
	start with hive, mid-level units that dont move
		careful with long range killing early explorers?
	when hive attacked, spawn high-level units, free non-moving

COMBAT
rethink move?
have to not move to charge attacks?
limit moving/attacking?
	ranged cant do both?
	melee limit move after attack? 
replace range with melee/ranged flag and accuracy(?), LOS rules, etc.
make num attacks/regen rate variables, reduce regen rate with dmg

map
	smaller?
	continguous
		force between core, hives, resources (? - ensure generate past gap?)
	water/islands
