NEW
	can upgrade to just interim step 
	cycle through move first, then build	
	consolidate explored points around 0 into range tuple
	hide unused columns for build extractor/turret/etc only
	enemies go after long range attackers (esp turrets)

	build turret starts with shields but upgrade doesnt
	
UI
	show sight range?
		fog will take care of?
	mouse over log entries to highlight
	if clicked log has no alive/visible pieces, go to attacked tile (store loc on log)
	for Log display, if selected piece didnt change dont refresh log
	selected piece shows double build range on mouse around
	better range drawing (no digit?  lines for cutoffs?  gradient?)?
	hard to see red on red one-hex range overlap
		also one-move min hard to see
	build form grows too big
	draw select on top of other ranges
		not done because need to see one-move minimum
	adjust scroll speed based on draw time

	highlight attacks from hidden enemies
		may be solved well enough by log improvements (click ability)
	hotkeys to jump to cardinal dir edges
	enemy move+range take into account unmovable tiles 
	minimap
	addtl logs? (repair? upgrade? build? research?)
	truncate range disp values
		since e.g. 2.0 may actually be 1.96 and not include 2 spaces away, so always show 1.9 if < 2
		include move cost indicator
		include cur move
	
GAMEPLAY

	core repair/range upgs?? maybe not...
random aliens path differnt directions if possible/available??
	esp faster aliens
	tough to do efficiently
entire tree too easily completed rn before game victory

	increase cost of late game techs
research popup on turn start too?
	really need to know what upgs you might be getting before moving units
	maybe time to eliminate weight for stored research entirely...
fog of war??
	might be more annoying than positive for gameplay
	but, vision should matter somehwat even if not scouting new areas
	maybe very delayed fog of war??
player pathfinding fallback when no space within initial restricted range
can turn off mechs to save energy
	but take time to come back online
	can also scrap for mass
enemy move calc tile probabilities in parallel

log debug to file
ensure everything within .5 (vision blocking) of core paths is terrain
turret range needs early buff again???
aliens move towards mechs with range on them
blockRadius needs to be Math.Sqrt(2) / 2 ??
chance to not place resource on destroyed extractor if value is really low
	very low extractors eventually disappear without even being killed
turret att/range tradeoff should be 1-1?
	and use StatValue
	dbl check def elsewhere for StatValue
	fix _rangeMult calc (fix min, avoid too extreme)
aliens really struggle to retreat and heal
	make more likely to jump to any available heal tile?
	new state not working? aliens parked outside visible still dont sit and heal?

improve getkillweight
	prioritize constructor>factory>extractor>core
		add another state to attack extractors

enemy attacks/moves	
	smarter about not attacking to recharge weapon
		always attack if about to die, otherwise favor recharge
	do they run away to charge shields?
	make better about not retreat pathing through player units
map contiguity / pathfinding / alien behavior
	constructors need to be able to reach resources
		just keep constructor limit very high and not worry about it for now?

		could add core and repair points as separate pathfind targets with same structure
			any way to share??
		spawn killable alien repair points in map paths too? every X distance?

	no need for a million points?
dont serialize Noise, save seed/params instead
TEST_MAP_GEN poorly designed, have to reference it everywhere we use visible 
	also shoudnt save map either
tie shield regen to StatValue (so regen more when lower)??
	make shield regen variable

hardcoded references to .5, .25 terrain cuttoffs			
movement - long term
	start with just inc, lose all at turn end
	reserach "battery" or "booster"

EARLY GAME
mitigate balance of finding resources quicker?
	distance to core? resource value?
better balancing of starting mech
	cost, speed/vision
constructor better vision? quicker new constructors?
	move?
	???
