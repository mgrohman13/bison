NEW
	can upgrade to just interim step 
	cycle through move first, then build	
	build form show distinction for can afford
	consolidate explored points around 0 into range tuple
	hide unused columns for build extractor/turret/etc only
	enemies go after long range attackers (esp turrets)
	enemies target with preference using AP/SP
	enemies dodge attacks
	income breakdown
	turrent chance to swap which attack does ap/sp?
	lower avg randomness?
	turret UpgradeBuildingCost sets rounding - affects shields
	reduce enemy ap/sp late
	increase avg shields
	decrease HP when shields,armor?
	armor + shields less likely
	ap + sp less likely
	ap/sp consistency in single unit?
		make multpl attacks more interesintg
	mouse move stops scroll
	show avg damage
	
IMPORTANT
	more move-left triggers (under attack, can attack if move, got attacked by unseen)
		ability disable for certain blueprints 	
	build turret starts with shields but upgrade doesnt
	
UI
	show sight range?
		fog will take care of?
	mouse over log entries to highlight
	if clicked log has no alive/visible pieces, go to attacked tile (store loc on log)
	for Log display, if selected piece didnt change dont refresh log
	selected piece shows double build range on mouse around
	better range drawing (no digit?  lines for cutoffs?  gradient?)?
	hard to see red on red one-hex range overlap
		also one-move min hard to see
	build form grows too big
	draw select on top of other ranges
		not done because need to see one-move minimum
	adjust scroll speed based on draw time
	off map edge logic not working well
	optimize drawrects to lines?
		might not even be optimization?
	optimize range drawing to single call
	toggle friendly range display
		filter by type, show total repair pct like enemy dmg
	show effects of research
	show constructor upgrade values
	show base values
		use tooltip for base value in attacks grid?
	highlight attacks from hidden enemies
		may be solved well enough by log improvements (click ability)
	hotkeys to jump to cardinal dir edges
	enemy move+range take into account unmovable tiles 
	minimap
	addtl logs? (repair? upgrade? build? research?)
	truncate range disp values
		since e.g. 2.0 may actually be 1.96 and not include 2 spaces away, so always show 1.9 if < 2
		include move cost indicator
		include cur move
	
GAMEPLAY
	attacker upgrades keep some old attacks/values
	unused upkeep on death?
	research/blueprint chances also based on current blueprints?
	use type research levels in blueprint cost?
	armor reduce with dmg?
	upkeep doesnt scale
	repair decrease with pow?
	negative mass/energy shuts things off
	enforce information hiding at project level

FEATURES
	current armor implementation = meh
	enemy hive
		protected by turrets
		constant spawn pct in dir
	calc with lines
		line of sight for vision while moving 
		stop when see new enemy?
		auto move to target
			tries to find squares closest to line 
			favors moving just past min range
		block attacks
	radar
		for resources
		also enemies?
	undo
	fog
	more units 
		enemy defensive structures
		mobile factory?
		teleporter?
		more interesting attacks (some not blocked by calc with lines)
	more abilities
	terrain
		blockers
		rubble/debris
			harvest
	experience
	power grid

buildings take more dmg somehow?
	auto repair only work when not attacked?
speed up attacks
	rounds = attackcur
    each roll range, draw on tie 
rethink picking defense algorithm, randomize slightly 
enemy attacks/moves	
	take into account new mechanics 
finish directional move/attack blocking
experience
scrap research doesnt lower cur?
	
remove outliers from att/def bar length?
pull gen/upgrade value constants, research powers into special consts we can see and tweak together
attack range circle not accurate around corners
support rallying, multiple moves to get to destination
use range atack OR move and melee
combined power grid, but if separate pieces impose power penalty?
	batteries - building/mechs
		excess power convert to research
	moving slower takes less energy?
speed game up somehow?
randomize tech tree
alien morale
metal types? 
right click piece info?
	attack though?? left click?
use tooltips?
	piece info on mouse over? 
	tutorial type stuff?
animations
	all attacks
	enemy moves
research
	upgs show amt - exact where can e.g. core shields
	exponential tiers - first excess power, then mining, etc.
true fractal noise... build on smaller with larger as map grows?
	how not retroactively affect explored??
alien types
	discover, reasearch?
	weaknesses? learn??
metagame system pts
	-1 to play
	get for win or lose
	spend for bonuses? unlocks? start with?
	beat normal unlocks hard difficulty?
evaluate use MemoryCache instead of Dictionary?
fix mirror image painting? may confuse in future?
building costs get more expensive with upgrade - countered by cost research
replace func tell you cost even if you cant afford
replace extractors?
disband mech
	turn off power?
	recycle?
int-based repair system
log colors for weapon/def types?
	better log readability in general
partial attacks?
	use specific attack
	rounds?
occasional moves take long
	generating resources?
more show attack options 
	hide diff parts
	e.g. lines only option 
notify cboxes that arent supported
after attack select to alien who actually defended
fix build/repair/upgrade weirdness?
	remove some research?
	or clear up with colors?
building upkeep?
	disband/disable option
map contiguity
	instead, dont have walls limit move?
		two diff kinds of walls? block and not block?
		ensure spawns can reach core with move
		ensure hive points have gaps "close enough"
	use pathfinding to enforce? convert blocks
	pathfind from point to center using some random move value
		every X attempts, add a terrain override tile somewhere reachable by one of closest points touched so far
		increase pathfinding move value slightly every step??
		after finding final path, if contains override tiles make them permament map features
		test alg by cutting cave connectors
show mass/eng ratio on build screen? round mechs to 10? energy to 10? div by 10?
minimap
shroud
	show last spotted aliens
	keep alien vision in shroud for 1 turn after move out of vision?
varaible scroll speed doesnt quite work
game stats
		
EARLY GAME
mitigate balance of finding resources quicker?
	distance to core? resource value?
better balancing of starting mech
	cost, speed/vision
constructor better vision? quicker new constructors?
	move?
	???
	constructor outrun too many early aliens?
hardcoded initial scout mech?
things a little too defensive?
caves
	start with hive, mid-level units that dont move
		careful with long range killing early explorers?
	when hive attacked, spawn high-level units, free non-moving

TOP PRIORITY
rework repair

COMBAT
rethink move?
have to not move to charge attacks?
limit moving/attacking?
	ranged cant do both?
	melee limit move after attack? 
replace range with melee/ranged flag and accuracy(?), LOS rules, etc.
make num attacks/regen rate variables, reduce regen rate with dmg

map
	smaller?
	continguous
		force between core, hives, resources (? - ensure generate past gap?)
	water/islands
