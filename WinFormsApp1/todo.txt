better combat logging 
	better formatting
	break down why?  
	also log to free space on panel 
different enemy strength in different dirs

build range
	and fix hideous build form
scrolling/panning limits can still only show non-visible corner and hence blank screen
mouse over attack to see specific range
mouse over move spot to see range from there
hotkey to stay put for turn, mechanism to un-stay
hotkeys to jump to cardinal dir edges
proper hiding of map borders until seen 
	enforce at project level
	can be gleaned from vision mechanics before seeing line 
show totals when things reduced (by hp% or by >max)
see agregates of multiple enemy attacks
order ships by position for prev/next
enemy behavior 
	currently always guaranteed to attack with shortest range attack 
		chance to skip it to hit different target with long range?
	target priorities 
integrate resilience stat into blueprints
enemy move+range take into account unmovable tiles 

radar
	for resources
	also enemies?
minimap
undo
fog
defensive structures
mobile factory?
terrain
	blockers
	rubble/debris
		harvest
experience
