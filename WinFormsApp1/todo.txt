enemy hive
	protected by turrets
	constant spawn pct in dir
repair decrease with pow?

info for core show genresources
repair randomness leaves some left 50% of the time
reapri doesnt stack? diminishing returns?
all buildings except core self repair?

mulitple repairers can spend too much mass when target goes to full
hard to see red on red one-hex range overlap
swap q and e?
minimap
negative mass/energy shuts things off
select next/prev starts at selected tile even if no piece
optimize drawing 
	stuff not on screen
	cache range calc results
has move left when can build anything, not just mech
show non-selected repair ranges
zooming based on center is awkward, usually opposite what you want
show move cost on mouse over
use tooltip for base value in attacks grid?
highlight attacks from hidden enemies
health bars
build range
	and fix hideous build form
scrolling/panning limits can still only show non-visible corner and hence blank screen
mouse over attack to see specific range
hotkeys to jump to cardinal dir edges
proper hiding of map borders until seen 
	enforce at project level
	can be gleaned from vision mechanics before seeing line 
integrate resilience stat into blueprints
enemy move+range take into account unmovable tiles 
not super happy with repairing
	repairing during combat too good? enemies target repairers preferably?
	repairing extrators too slow

calc with lines
	line of sight for vision while moving 
	stop when see new enemy?
	auto move to target
		tries to find squares closest to line 
		favors moving just past min range

upgrade things with latest research
	turrets
	constructor, factory for better repair?
radar
	for resources
	also enemies?
minimap
undo
fog
defensive structures
mobile factory?
terrain
	blockers
	rubble/debris
		harvest
experience
