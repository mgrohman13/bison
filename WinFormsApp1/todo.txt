	select next/prev starts at selected tile even if no piece
	zooming based on center is awkward, usually opposite what you want
	double click to select research
	show mech upgrade comparison
	show building costs somehwere

	last space should deselect
	space should not trigger buttons
	show research progress/cost on main form
	better emphasis when upgradeable
		show constructor upgradeable
	truncate range disp values
		since e.g. 2.0 may actually be 1.96 and not include 2 spaces away, so always show 1.9 if < 2
		
UI			
	selected piece shows double build range on mouse around
	better range drawing (no digit?  lines for cutoffs?  gradient?)?
	more move-left triggers (under attack, can attack if move)
		ability disable for certain blueprints 	
	hard to see red on red one-hex range overlap
		also one-move min hard to see
	draw select on top of other ranges
		not done because need to see one-move minimum
	HP bars (shield bars?)
	adjust scroll speed based on draw time
	optimize drawing 
		stuff not on screen 
		optimize circles to single draw call
		optimize drawrects to lines?
	show effects of research
	show base values
		use tooltip for base value in attacks grid?

		may be solved well enough by log improvements (click ability)
	hotkeys to jump to cardinal dir edges
	enemy move+range take into account unmovable tiles 
	minimap
