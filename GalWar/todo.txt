GAMEPLAY

ship type chances
	increase old research penalty to weight
revisit research chances
	upgrade?
	num designs more impactful
AskProductionOrDefense show reduced StoreProd value (non-ask amt too?)
anomaly prod add to non-active?
salvage ship
	prevent enemy attack?
	prevent death star near planet?
punish neg gold
	interest?
	take cut of income > emphasis pct?  GoldProductionForGold?
enforce attacking with all avail pop
bombard
	free dmg use non-player-specific cost
	free dmg/attack pct left takes into account att hp
	bombard combat get exp out instead of automatic add
	bombard friendly paying for value exp at full rate vs exp rate?
	free dmg vs too good?  no risk for attacker?
anomaly gold balancing at full vs consolation value
	using generate value instead of this value for compensation?
	other compensation/general balancing?
	rebalance global event?
	gold income for anomaly research randomness
	anom design research randomness with higher values
		any pct based / OE randomness?
	anomaly add/lose pop redistribute to other colonies if over upper cap if possible?
1:1 vs reduced payouts... analyze
	e.g. soldiers "other" gives full gold?
rand rounded gold balancing or not - why? rate?
rchance > 1 throws off max
[NonSerialized] fields should deserialize to standard values (NaN vs 0)


BETWEEN GAMES

	
startGold power
buildable/repair/pd rework 
	prod repair
		build soldier, pd randonly round 0-1 (build only, not upgrade, automatic)
	UI needs ship repair cbox 
	display planet values?
	show defenseResearch
	reducing pd stats/hp
	hp ratio?
		slighter more hp if stats not reduced?
		random?
	standardize mindefenses, hp, str, cost checks
	display PD target stats
	turnstuff refs for infrstrctr
	avg gold (also remove min)
	pdform show infrstr inc info 
	tradeprodform click auto buy for infrastructure 
	suspend PD/sldr build?
		needs downside - increased upk at minimum, prob more
	prod guess
	game starting values
	test new planet infrstrctr over time
	reuse ship design max cost functionality for infrastructure (use min of mins) 
	double check quick prod text summary makes sense
		+colony summary
	upg PD / sold stored values store income?
	manual/new prod interaction
	next ships in reapair line pick up extra prod after last maxxed
		
research victory pct decreases with higher research
	10k=now
	30k=85% instead of 67%?
	uses real avg, graph calcs using average shown
	also decrease max display skew appropriately
	actual chance vs display discrepency?	
trans upk payoff problem
	upkeep IS more severe, but cost ends up being reduced
	reduce impact of speed in general, while at it?
	att/def adjusts slightly?
in progress
	turn inc calc
		mingold - remove?
	buy/sell/obsolete during callback
		allow sometimes
		restrict at handler wrapper level
are fine?
	max design cost OE??
	level up uses full research?
		change to last?
6 tiers saved? return length?
graph dictionaries can be arrays
standardize Tile.Game vs Player.Game calls
remove static qualifiers to same class
standardize dead checks
clean up code
	member order
