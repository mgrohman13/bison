GAMEPLAY

neg gold should take from infra?
anom exp DS check invade?
anom free PD/sold resets maxes
game starts with gold emphasis (prob caused by neg gold)
game start doesnt need prod handler first turn
anomaly gold balancing at full vs consolation value
	using generate value instead of this value for compensation?
	other compensation/general balancing?
	rebalance global event?
	anom design research randomness with higher values
		any pct based / OE randomness?
1:1 vs reduced payouts... analyze
rand rounded gold balancing or not - why? rate?
sell soldiers?
	also on trans? only planet?
[NonSerialized] fields should deserialize to standard values (NaN vs 0)
standardize mindefenses, hp, str, cost checks
buy/sell/obsolete during callback
	allow sometimes
	restrict at handler wrapper level
standardize Tile.Game vs Player.Game calls
remove static qualifiers to same class
standardize dead checks
clean up code
	member order


BETWEEN GAMES

negative gold??
new game parameters
	num anomalies (start/rate)
	differentiate starting and planet rate
	pop,prod,etc.
graph dictionaries can be arrays
	test sizes...
fix combatant/popcarrier/colony/pd hierarchy?


FEATURES

civ zoc?
	move through friendly?
	rebalance?
more individual colony/planet variation?
	problem - people piling all excess pop on best planet
	maybe only up to quality?
terrain
	from anomalies?
	non-permanent
	slower move
	impassable
	damage
	att/def bonus
	random spread of tiles?
	apply effects to neighbors?
influence
	controls anomalies, nuetral planets?
	zoc?
	spread by something that requires upkeep
neutral ships?
	from anomaly?
known enemy designs
AI
	integrate AI-algorithm guesses into game for player to use as well
	event needs to be pulled out of other handler stuff and only show events for things visible to other players
shroud
directly upgrade existing ships?
	to reduce repair cost?
	improve stats?
	obsolete designs?
special ship abilities
	stop combat?
	level up during combat?


rethink:

planets have diff g/r/p ratios, change randomly over time 
PD - built automatically with pct, option to build intentionally
soldiers?

build PD/repair in discrete chunks
	specific schematics
	repair drone?

gold income - instead of estimating, force consistency at turn end, and push offset to following turn, where previous offset is guaranteed

rethink prod system entirely again?
	store with certain research pct?
	decreases as research goes up? higher in general?
	build from pool, no stored prod?

info hiding
	shroud!
	ship repair - ?
	research?
		income ratios change over time, not on a time when you check/uncheck?
		just literally show research?
			could snowball....
	gold repair - ?
	maybe dont prioritize info hiding at all costs...
