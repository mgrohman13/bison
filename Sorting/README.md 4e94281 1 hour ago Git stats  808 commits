Graphical visualizer of different sorting algorithms.  Supports generating and sorting differnt distributions of random data.  All sorts are implemented in-place, and the number of comparisons and swaps are counted.

Sorting algorithms:  
**QuickSort** - standard quick sort with randomly chosen pivot  
**Shell Sort** - Uses the optimized gnome sort as its inner loop, instead of insertion as is typical.  Step sizes are randomly chosen based on the size of the data, with an average factor of 2.2 between steps.  This sort turns out to be quite efficient for the semi-smallish data sets this application can handle (<=1,000,000).  
**Heap Sort** - standard heap sort  
**"Kronrod"** - A nameless sorting algorithm pieced together from the works of M. A. Kronrod and others.  It is an in-place merge sort implementation that uses an unsorted section to merge two sorted ones.  
**Smooth Sort** - An infamously complex heapsort algortihm that maintains a Leonardo heap rather than a binary tree.  Similar in performance to a standard heapsort, but performs significatly better on already somewhat-sorted data because the tree is constructed right-to-left instead of left-to-right.  
**Bitonic** - bitonic sorting network modified to work for arbitrary list length  
**Merge Sort** - This uses the basic mergesort algorithm but with some hand-rolled changes to the merge method to work in place.  The result is quite poorly performing.  Much better in-place merge sorting algorithms exist.  
**Strand Sort** - in-place variant of the strand sort, almost just as efficient as the standard  
**Gnome** - optimized gnome sort that stores the topmost position and returns to it immediately to take out some unnecessary comparisons  
**Cocktail** - a bubble sort that alternates each direction  
**Odd-Even** - standard odd-even sort  
**Bubble** - optimized bubble sort that breaks out early when the list is sorted  
**Bozo Sort** - This is an optimized bozo sort that can actually evebntually finish on a human timescale.  It only swaps elements if they are out of order.  A true bozo sort always swaps the two randomly chosen elements.  
**Stooge Sort** - the stooge sort is horribly inefficient but surprisingly ingenious  
**Radix LSD** - does no comparisons, relies on sorting integer data  
**Radix MSD** - does no comparisons, relies on sorting integer data
