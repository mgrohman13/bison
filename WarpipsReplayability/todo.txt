bug - after multiple cycles in a mission, shows stronger bar on next operation

vary validation based on difficulty (num territories w/o super soldiers changes)
0 = 0.080, 12
1 = 0.090, 11
2 = 0.100, 10
3 = 0.115, 9

mess with spawning, true mission randomness

normalize difficulty bar threshhold?

incl all territies in tech decrease, but cap at 20?
