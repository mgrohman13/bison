hide operation map in shroud

rebalance island completion somehow
	change to +3 per territory, div to /3?
		small reduction to special territories?
	do something with worldMapDifficultyMultipler
		add marathon mode option
	utilize TerritoryInstance.blocked?
		test what it does
	
buy warpip give x2
	other useless purchases?

make first island easiest missions harder

vary validation based on difficulty (num territories w/o super soldiers changes)
0 = 0.080
1
2
3 = 0.115

mess with spawning, true mission randomness
