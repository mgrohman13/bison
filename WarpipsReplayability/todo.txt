rebalance island completion somehow
	do something with worldMapDifficultyMultipler
		add marathon mode option?
			reduce all tech points, reduce worldMapDifficultyMultipler
	utilize TerritoryInstance.blocked?
		test what it does

make first island easiest missions harder

vary validation based on difficulty (num territories w/o super soldiers changes)
0 = 0.080, 12
1 = 0.090, 11
2 = 0.100, 10
3 = 0.115, 9

mess with spawning, true mission randomness
