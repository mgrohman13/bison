utilize TerritoryInstance.blocked?
	test what it does

rebalance island completion somehow?
	seems too strong (certainly for islands 1-2)
	do something with worldMapDifficultyMultipler?
	use tech rewards?
		add ~2.1 per territory
		cut in half after full bar (not end, but what about special?)
make first island harder
buy warpip give x2?

vary validation based on difficulty (num territories w/o super soldiers changes)
0 = 0.080
1
2
3 = 0.115

mess with spawning, true mission randomness
