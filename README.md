# bison

A collection of (primarily C#) code projects spanning from now back to 2005.  These are mostly games, as well as some utilities, and some inexplicable messing-around type nonsense.


Arcade games - play until you lose, attempting to get the highest score you can:
SpaceRunner
Trogdor
Zombies
Tetwist
SquirrelThrower
Gravity
CollectorKiller
CGame
Space2D


Turn-based strategy games - highly refined, great gameplay with innovative concepts, but no decent graphics or AI:
GalWar
CityWar
Daemons


Other projects of note:
MattUtil - PRNG and other utilities used between multiple projects
Sorting - visualizer for different sorting algorithms
RandomWalk - weird screensaver
SearchUtil - simple GUI app to search windows file contents, written for a semi-technical friend
LeaviathanProwl - mod for the game Subnautica (WIP)
VueJS - simple game to learn some vue.js 


Some projects have their own README.
